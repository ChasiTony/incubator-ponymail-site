#Download Pony Mail

While we do not have any official Apache releases yet, you may check out
previous non-Apache releases on our GitHub repo, at
[https://github.com/apache/incubator-ponymail/releases](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ponymail/releases).

While these are all Apache License v/2-approved, they have not gone
through the traditional Apache release process, and as such, are not
officially endorsed by the Apache Pony Mail project in any way.
